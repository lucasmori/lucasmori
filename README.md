Developed in Node.js, React Native and Expo, hosted on Heroku and using GitHub Actions for CI, this project consists
of the development of an application capable of developing a diet based on the person's current physical size and 
their physical goal. Based on the data provided by the user, the App must perform a metabolic analysis and with this 
processed information, it may be able to offer a proposed diet to be followed and the nutrients and calories needed 
for that purpose. The user can obtain a diet and its necessary consumption of nutrients to reach its goals, quickly 
and intuitively.
